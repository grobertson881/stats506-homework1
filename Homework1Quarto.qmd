**Problem 1**

1a)
```{r}
# Read in data and assign column names
abaloneData <- read.table("/Users/gracerobertson/Desktop/stats506/abalone/abalone.data", sep = ",")
abaloneNames <- c("Sex", "Length", "Diameter", "Height", "Whole Weight", "Shucked Weight", 
                  "Viscera Weight", "Shell Weight", "Rings")
colnames(abaloneData) <- abaloneNames
```

1b)
```{r}
# Report number of observations from each sex
numMData = length(which(abaloneData$Sex == "M"))
numFData = length(which(abaloneData$Sex == "F"))
numIData = length(which(abaloneData$Sex == "I"))
print(paste("Number of Male Observations: ", numMData))
print(paste("Number of Female Observations: ", numFData))
print(paste("Number of Infant Observations: ", numIData))
```

There are 1528 male observations, 1307 female observations, and 1342 infant observations.
